<H1>cpipe --- counting pipe</H1>

    <p>Did you ever want to know how fast your <code>tar</code> is or
      how much data it has transferred already. How about using
      <code>socket</code> or <code>nc</code> to copy files either with
      or without compression over a fast network connection, which one
      is faster?
      
    <p>If you want to know the answer, use <code>cpipe</code> as a
    totally <em>unscientific</em> approach to measure throughput.
    <code>Cpipe</code> copies its standard input to its standard output
    while measuring the time it takes to read an input buffer and
    write an output buffer. Statistics of average throughput and the
    total amount of bytes copied are printed to the standard error
    output.

    <p>You may download <code>cpipe</code> as <a
    href="cpipe-|VERSION|.tar.gz">cpipe-|VERSION|.tar.gz</a> or as <a
    href="cpipe-|VERSION|-0.i386.rpm">cpipe-|VERSION|-0.i386.rpm</a>.

    <p><a href="dir.ttml">Old versions</a> are available as well as a
      <a href="CHANGES">change log</a>.
